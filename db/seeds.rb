As a baby, Chris Traeger was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder and was only supposed to live for 3 weeks, but he survived and is therefore always an optimistic person. He frequently compares his body to a microchip, saying that a grain of sand could destroy it. He has 2.8 percent body fat. He believes he will be the first person to live to 150. He also commonly refers to people by their first and last name.",

      about: "Jerry is a married father of three girls, who works for the Department of Parks and Recreation. Jerry was often mistreated due to his embarrassing history, which is a collection of awkward incidents resulting from his apparent clumsiness and ineptitude. He has a strong artistic side. He once created a mural of an alcove of Pawnee City Hall, which was actually composed of small pictures of Pawnee citizens. He is also a skilled pianist and an amateur inventor. Due to his reputation as a sad excuse for a human, Jerry is often dismissed even if he is clearly in the right and what he has created is breathtaking. Jerry is a frequent customer at Sherm's Ice Cream parlor in Muncie, where he drops his ice cream about half the time",
