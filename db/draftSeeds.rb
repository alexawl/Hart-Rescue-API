  about: "Ron Swanson has a deadpan personality and seldom expresses any kind of emotion, although he is often shown to be very giddy when it comes to riddles and meat. He adheres to many stereotypically masculine traits. He claims to have only cried twice: once when he was hit by a school bus at age 7; secondly when miniature horse Li'l Sebastian died. Ron is an outdoor enthusiast who loves hunting, fishing, camping, and woodworking. For years, Ron has used a park ranger station in the woods as a lodge for private hunting trips with his male colleagues at city hall. He loves breakfast foods and red meats; among the types of food he enjoys are bacon-wrapped shrimp, fried turkey legs inside a grilled hamburger, and bacon-wrapped turkey legs"

Ben is often teased for his affinity for, references to,and vast knowledge in Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, Game of Thrones and other things considered to be nerdy. His love for calzones is also well known. Ben created a game called The Cones of Dunshire.",
