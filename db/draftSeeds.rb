  about: "Although born in the neighboring rival town of Eagleton, due to the fact that the Pawnee hospital was overrun with raccoons, Leslie is a definite Pawneean. She vowed early on to give back to this vibrant and fascinating town by living a life of public service. Leslie graduated top of her class at Pawnee Dog School, where she was Co-Vice President of the student body. Leslie is an over-achiever who lives to serve. Leslie Knope is extremely cheerful, ambitious, hard-working and optimistic, and loves waffles."

  about: "Ron Swanson has a deadpan personality and seldom expresses any kind of emotion, although he is often shown to be very giddy when it comes to riddles and meat. He adheres to many stereotypically masculine traits. He claims to have only cried twice: once when he was hit by a school bus at age 7; secondly when miniature horse Li'l Sebastian died. Ron is an outdoor enthusiast who loves hunting, fishing, camping, and woodworking. For years, Ron has used a park ranger station in the woods as a lodge for private hunting trips with his male colleagues at city hall. He loves breakfast foods and red meats; among the types of food he enjoys are bacon-wrapped shrimp, fried turkey legs inside a grilled hamburger, and bacon-wrapped turkey legs"

  about: "Ben is very serious, mature and work-oriented, and usually doesn't seem fazed by much of the immature, eccentric behavior from some of the other members of the Pawnee Barks and Recreation Department. Ben is often teased for his affinity for, references to,and vast knowledge in Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, Game of Thrones and other things considered to be nerdy. His love for calzones is also well known. Ben created a game called The Cones of Dunshire.",
